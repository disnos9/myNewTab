# My New Tab
My New Tab is an extension for Chromium-based browsers to change your new tab page. We are working on expanding this out to more browsers, but most browsers support Chromium extensions soo...

## How to Install - Chrome
### Step 1: Download the extension
Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/disnos9/myNewTab/releases/latest) and download the Source Code (zip) for the most recent release. Then, unzip the file.

### Step 2: Installing the extension
Go to your extensions page (link depends on your browser - the only listed links are browsers My New Tab was tested on)<br>
Chrome - chrome://extensions<br>
Brave - brave://extensions<br>
If your browser is Chromium-based, the Chrome link should work.<br>

### Step 3: Enable Developer Mode
At the top right, tick the switch that says "Developer mode". You will see a lot more information about extensions appear on your page. Your page should look something like the image below.<br>
